                  This app is made to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in communities. Made for schools, this app allows homeroom teachers to
                  have a digital database of students' testing records to keep track of the health of student and filter them based on their name, student ID, and their testing status (none, cleared, pending, uncleared). Ideally, this
                  app's users would be homeroom teachers in a school. That way a teacher would only have to manage a certain group of students for
                  the academic year as oposed to managing each class of students they teach.
